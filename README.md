### 1 Computational Solutions through Co-Design
Addressing the Needs of 3 Individuals With Disabilities Through Thoughtful, Co-Designed Computational Solutions
- **Date**: April 2024
- **Course**: Design in Action
- **Professor**: Prof. Seth Thompson
- **Advisor**: Prof. William Martin

Computational Solutions through Co-Design originated with a goal to retrofit my grandmother's home to better accommodate her changing needs as she aged and faced new disabilities. The aim was to move beyond universal design principles, focusing on personalized solutions. This collaboration with my grandmother allowed us to develop tailored adaptations for her specific disabilities, directly addressing her unique circumstances and environment. Following my grandmother's passing, the project evolved while maintaining its objectives. It pivoted towards using computational tools to empower 3 other individuals in my family with disabilities through co-design. This shift involved conducting three case studies, each focusing on creating solutions for individuals with distinct disabilities, leveraging machine learning and handheld computational technologies to enhance personal independence.

1. Traffic Light Detection for Color Blindness: This study developed a system for a person with red-green color blindness, helping them navigate traffic signals via a hardware-software integration that uses AI to detect traffic lights and provide audio cues.
2. Assistive Money Counter for the Elderly: Focused on an elderly individual with vision and cognitive challenges, this case study produced a computer vision system that recognizes and counts currency, offering auditory feedback on the total amount for greater financial autonomy.
3. Sign and Text Overlay for Limited Vision: Aimed at assisting an individual with limited vision and cognitive disabilities, this system uses optical character recognition combined with language models to simplify and summarize text from signs and printed materials, providing accessible visual and auditory outputs.

The project is a user-initiated, design-for-one approach that contrasts with one-size-fits-all solutions. It emphasizes the importance of personalization and the innovative potential within the disability community, serving as a continuous testbed for new ideas. By embedding personalized technology into everyday environments, the project enhances independence.

### 2 Gene and Jude's Kitchen

Gene & Jude's Dynamic and Historic Kitchen and the Preparation of a Simple Hot Dog

![Gene & Jude's Kitchen](https://github.com/ensinger/GSAPP/blob/c0479f898230bb2c2a54b27cbaecc4e4586b7783/gene%20and%20judes%20kitchen.jpg?raw=true "Gene & Jude's Chicago-style 'depression dog'")

- **Date**: February 2024
- **Course**: Feasting and Fasting
- **Professor**: Prof. Ateya Khorakiwala

When my Bubbe and Pa picked me up from the airport in Chicago on my Bubbe’s birthday, they took me to Gene & Jude's. I am typically a vegetarian, but I eat these. Eating Chicago-style hot dogs, one of my all-time favorite foods, makes me feel more connected to my dad and his side of my family. Gene & Jude's specializes in an old-style Chicago dog, known as a depression dog, and has been around since 1946. Unlike the "dragged through the garden" Chicago dog, this version doesn't have tomatoes, pickles, or poppy-seed buns. Waiting in line for about 20 minutes, you can see the whole kitchen and every step: potatoes hand-cranked into fries, then dropped into oil. (The fries are my Bubbe’s favorite part). The dogs come out of the pot, topped with brown relish instead of green, mustard, sport peppers (my favorite part), and white onions. The fries are poured over the hot dogs, then wrapped in paper, ready to be devoured in the car. There are no seats, and Gene & Jude's adheres to the Chicago tradition of no ketchup on site.

The Speculative Restoration Design Tool is designed to speculate and reconstruct architectural facades using foundational elements such as window jambs, sills, and heads. Focused on Art Nouveau and Beaux-Arts styles, the tool leverages these elements to restore and reimagine buildings in Detroit. The project began with the aim to visualize the possible original facades of buildings in Detroit by using architectural remnants. This not only helps in restoration but also serves as a creative tool for world-building in CGI rendering. Using tools like Rhino and Grasshopper, site boundaries are identified and rounded off for further processing. Base geometries are created from building footprints and user-defined parameters like height and panel sizes. Facades are subdivided based on user inputs, using Python to allow variations like alternating window distances. UV coordinates of surfaces are unified using Rhino Common to ensure consistent window orientation. Users can toggle between uniform and alternating subdivisions to control the facade's appearance dynamically. The tool includes a Grasshopper Geometry Preview for real-time visualization and a user-friendly UI plugin for easy adjustments. While primarily used for architectural restoration, the tool's ability to generate diverse building designs rapidly makes it suitable for CGI and other forms of digital modeling.

### 6 Visualizing Confirmed Hate Crime Incidents in NYC During the Covid-19 Pandemic

Mapping NYPD Confirmed Hate Crimes and Examining the Social Dynamics and Biases That May Influence This Data

- **Date**: August 2023
- **Course**: Methods as Practice, Practice as Methods
- **Professor**: Prof. Violet Whitney, Prof. William Martin

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States witnessed a distressing rise in hate crimes, intensified by inflammatory rhetoric and high-profile incidents of police brutality. This project focuses on visualizing the pattern of confirmed hate crimes in New York City from 2019 to 2023. Using data from the NYPD, the analysis reveals geographical distribution and victim demographics of these crimes. I integrated the NYPD data with the policy precinct shapefile in Grasshopper, where I experimented with various visualization techniques including extruding the shapefile based on certain attributes and applying gradients to others, thereby providing a multidimensional view of the data. Key findings include a 15,000% spike in anti-Asian hate crimes from 2019 to 2021, attributed largely to Covid-19 related racism. Anti-Semitic incidents were most prevalent, accounting for about 43.7% of all cases, while anti-Black hate crimes showed a notable concentration in Staten Island. The project discusses the likely underreporting of incidents due to victims' reluctance to involve law enforcement, particularly among marginalized communities with historical mistrust of police.

Dynamic User-centric Control, Movement, Behavior, and Activities

- **Date**: December 2023
- **Course**: Spatial UX
- **Professor**: Prof. Violet Whitney
- **Partners**: Di Zhu, Chuxi Xiong, Pavitra Nayak

The goal of Spatial UX was giving users the ability to shape their spaces according to their needs. We used real-time object detection and neural network analysis to track user movement in videos they filmed of themselves making breakfast in their kitchens and suggested changes to the room design such as equipment placement and room sizes. The goal was to balance efficiency and functionality. After the users received the suggestions, we collected feedback from the users and imagined an exciting future in spatial design.

### 8 Culinary Coexistence: Negotiating Religious Practice in a Pluralistic Jewish Co-op

Negotiating Religious and Dietary Practice and Identity and Kashrut Dietary Laws as Catalysts for Dialogue in a Pluralistic Jewish Food Co-op

- **Date**: April 2024
- **Course**: Feasting and Fasting
- **Professor**: Prof. Ateya Khorakiwala

<img src="https://github.com/ensinger/GSAPP/blob/main/IMG_7463.jpg" alt="bayit1" width="30%"> <img src="https://github.com/ensinger/GSAPP/blob/main/IMG_0317.jpg" alt="bayit2" width="30%"> <img src="https://github.com/ensinger/GSAPP/blob/main/IMG_7370.jpg" alt="bayit3" width="30%"> <img src="https://github.com/ensinger/GSAPP/blob/main/IMG_7793.jpg" alt="bayit4" width="30%">



Culinary Coexistence is about the dynamics of communal living and religious practice at The Beit Ephraim Food Co-op (The Bayit), a pluralistic Jewish food co-op at Columbia University. It explores how residents with varying levels of religious observance negotiate their personal religious commitments within a shared living space. Central to this negotiation is the co-op's maintenance of a kosher kitchen, which becomes both a catalyst for and a source of contention in these negotiations. Through house member interviews, alumni interviews, participant observations, and house meeting analyses, the project examines the residents' diverse approaches to kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), Shabbat observance, and broader Jewish identity and Israeli discourse. The project aims to understand how such communal settings reflect broader societal interactions within the Jewish community, focusing on how identity and religious practice contribute to the production of meaning in the face of conflict and negotiation. This project is also about the role of pluralism and inclusivity in communal living and the balance between accommodation and adherence to religious norms.

### 9 Losing Ground: Erosion is Threatening Long Island's Historic Communities

Addressing the Persistent Issue of Shoreline Degradation in Long Island

- **Date**: April 2024
- **Course**: Sustainability and Preservation
- **Professor**: Prof. Erica Avrami

Losing Ground is about community decision-making, environmental challenges, and infrastructure projects on Long Island. Specifically, this project focuses on cases involving coastal erosion and management which exemplify different approaches to addressing the persistent issue of shoreline degradation and the consequences of various management strategies for historic sites that are eventual inevitable loss due to climate change. Port Jefferson’s Coastal Wall was initiated as part of the local village's ongoing efforts to prevent their historic country club from succumbing to coastal erosion. The construction of a large $10 million double wall system did not withstand its first winter, highlighting the challenges and financial strains of maintaining hard infrastructure against natural forces. The unintended environmental impacts of a sea wall at Jones Beach led to significant erosion on an adjacent beach. These cases show the necessity for comprehensive environmental impact assessments and considering the interconnectedness of coastal ecosystems. The adoption of living shorelines in Long Island is a sustainable approach to shoreline management through the use of living shorelines. This method prevents erosion and preserves the natural landscape and biodiversity, an example of environmentally-conscious decision-making. Long Island inspires questions about the management of coastal environments, demonstrating the need for sustainable planning and more ecologically and economically sustainable practices like living shorelines and forward-thinking strategies in coastal management.
