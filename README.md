### Projects Overview

#### Computational Solutions through Co-Design
Addressing the needs of 3 individuals with disabilities through thoughtful, co-designed computational solutions
- **Date**: April 2024
- **Course**: Design in Action
- **Professor**: Prof. Seth Thompson
- **Advisor**: Prof. William Martin

Computational Solutions through Co-Design originated with a goal to retrofit my grandmother's home to better accommodate her changing needs as she aged and faced new disabilities. The aim was to move beyond universal design principles, focusing on personalized solutions. This collaboration with my grandmother allowed us to develop tailored adaptations for her specific disabilities, directly addressing her unique circumstances and environment.

Following my grandmother's passing, the project evolved while maintaining its objectives. It pivoted towards using computational tools to empower 3 other individuals in my family with disabilities through co-design. This shift involved conducting three case studies, each focusing on creating solutions for individuals with distinct disabilities, leveraging machine learning and handheld computational technologies to enhance personal independence.

1. Traffic Light Detection for Color Blindness: This study developed a system for a person with red-green color blindness, helping them navigate traffic signals via a hardware-software integration that uses AI to detect traffic lights and provide audio cues.
2. Assistive Money Counter for the Elderly: Focused on an elderly individual with vision and cognitive challenges, this case study produced a computer vision system that recognizes and counts currency, offering auditory feedback on the total amount for greater financial autonomy.
3. Sign and Text Overlay for Limited Vision: Aimed at assisting an individual with limited vision and cognitive disabilities, this system uses optical character recognition combined with language models to simplify and summarize text from signs and printed materials, providing accessible visual and auditory outputs.

The project showcases a user-initiated, design-for-one approach that contrasts with one-size-fits-all solutions. It emphasizes the importance of personalization and the innovative potential within the disability community, serving as a continuous testbed for new ideas. By embedding personalized technology into everyday environments, the project enhances independence.

#### Losing Ground: Erosion is Threatening Long Island's Historic Communities
Addressing the persistent issue of shoreline degradation in Long Island
- **Date**: April 2024
- **Course**: Sustainability and Preservation
- **Professor**: Prof. Erica Avrami

Losing Ground is about community decision-making, environmental challenges, and infrastructure projects on Long Island. Specifically, this project focuses on cases involving coastal erosion and management which exemplify different approaches to addressing the persistent issue of shoreline degradation and the consequences of various management strategies for historic sites that are eventual inevitable loss due to climate change. Port Jeffersonâ€™s Coastal Wall was initiated as part of the local village's ongoing efforts to prevent their historic country club from succumbing to coastal erosion. The construction of a large $10 million double wall system did not withstand its first winter, highlighting the challenges and financial strains of maintaining hard infrastructure against natural forces. The unintended environmental impacts of a sea wall at Jones Beach led to significant erosion on an adjacent beach. These cases show the necessity for comprehensive environmental impact assessments and the interconnectedness of coastal ecosystems. The adoption of living shorelines in Long Island is a sustainable approach to shoreline management through the use of living shorelines. This method not only prevents erosion but also preserves the natural landscape and biodiversity, showcasing the benefits of community-involved, and environmentally-conscious decision-making. Long Island inspires questions about the management of coastal environments, demonstrating the need for sustainable planning and more ecologically and economically sustainable practices like living shorelines, and forward-thinking strategies in coastal management.
